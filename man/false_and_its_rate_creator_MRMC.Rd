\title{MRMC: False Alarm Creator For each Modality and each Reader.}
\usage{
false_and_its_rate_creator_MRMC(z.truth = BayesianFROC::z_truth,
  NI = 333, NL = 111, ModifiedPoisson = FALSE, seed = 12345,
  M = 5, Q = 4, summary = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{z.truth}{Vector of dimension = C represents the thresholds of bi-normal assumption.}

\item{NI}{The number of images.}

\item{NL}{The number of lesions.}

\item{ModifiedPoisson}{This is dichotomous, that is \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If
\code{ModifiedPoisson = TRUE}, then Poisson rate of false alarm are \code{per lesion},
and if \code{ModifiedPoisson = FALSE}, then Poisson rate of false alarm are \code{per image}.
To know detail, refer the author's paper in which I explained per image and per lesion.}

\item{seed}{The seed for creating false alarm which are generated by the Poisson  distributions using the specified seed.}

\item{M}{Number of modalities}

\item{Q}{Number of readers}

\item{summary}{TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE then summary and estimates are printed in the R console. If FALSE, the output is minimal.}
}
\value{
Vector for false alarms as an element of list of MRMC data.

\description{
From threshold, mean and S.D., data of False Alarm are created.#'@details
In our hierarchical model, false alarm rate does not depend on the readers or modalities. Thus this sampling function merely draws samples from the Poisson distribution of the same false alarm rate. Of course, this same false rate of the Poisson distributions is not desired one. Since we should assume that each reader with different modality should differ. To accomplish this, we have to assume that threshold parameter of Gaussian assumption should depend on the reader and modality. But such model does not converge in the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation.
