\title{Draw the FROC  curves}
\usage{
DrawCurves_srsc(StanS4class, title = TRUE, indexCFPCTP = FALSE,
  upper_x, upper_y, new.imaging.device = TRUE, Drawcol = TRUE,
  DrawFROCcurve = TRUE, DrawAFROCcurve = FALSE, DrawCFPCTP = TRUE,
  Draw.inner.circle.for.CFPCTPs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{StanS4class}{fitted model object, from an output of \code{rstan::sampling()}.}

\item{title}{logical: TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE(default), then title of curves are drawn.}

\item{indexCFPCTP}{TRUE of FALSE. If TRUE, then the cumulative false and hits are specified with its confidence level.}

\item{upper_x}{This is a upper bound for the axis of the horisontal coordinate of FROC curve.}

\item{upper_y}{This is a upper bound for the axis of the vertical coordinate of FROC curve.}

\item{new.imaging.device}{Logical: \code{TRUE} of \code{FALSE}. If TRUE (default), then open a new device to draw curve.
Using this we can draw curves in same plain by new.imaging.device=FALSE.}

\item{Drawcol}{Logical: \code{TRUE} of \code{FALSE}. Whether the (A)FROC curve is to be drawn  by using color of dark theme. The default value is a \code{TRUE}.}

\item{DrawFROCcurve}{logical: TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not FROC curves are shown.}

\item{DrawAFROCcurve}{logical: TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not AFROC curves are shown.}

\item{DrawCFPCTP}{logical: TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not CFPCTP points are shown.}

\item{Draw.inner.circle.for.CFPCTPs}{TRUE or FALSE. If true, then to plot the cumulative false positives and true positives the plot points is depicted by two way, one is a large circle and one is a small circle. By see the small circle, user can see the more precise position of these points.}
